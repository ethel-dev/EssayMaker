{"name":"EssayMaker","tagline":"An open source graphic essay organizer built from the ground up using web technologies.","body":"EssayMaker is a much needed update of a very helpful but outdated tool used to help students write essays: the graphical essay organizer. It has all of the speed and features of a word processor, and all of the organization of an organizer. Write your essay in the organizer, and export it as a finished product, ready to share. It's as simple as that.\r\n\r\n## Platform friendly\r\nEssayMaker is built on Bootstrap, a mobile first framework. Of course, depending on the browser version you are using some features may not work, I have done everything I can to make EssayMaker as smooth of an experience as possible.\r\n\r\n## Functional, minimalist design\r\nEssayMaker is designed with a no eyesore, no clutter philosophy. Nothing is there when you don't need it. Everything is there when you do. While simple, EssayMaker doesn't sacrifice functionality or beauty. EssayMaker is an environment you can focus in and get stuff done in.\r\n\r\n## Free and easy-to-use\r\nEssayMaker is absolutely free with no paywalls or licenses, no distracting ads, and no popups, because unlike [some people](http://company.king.com/) I actually care about the experience of my users. If you're feeling nice, you can donate to my [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=TUFL9KWZGXZE2).\r\n\r\n## Open-source\r\nVisit EssayMaker on GitHub to request features and report bugs, or even submit a pull request and add your own features.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
