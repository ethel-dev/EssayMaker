#### Day One, 10/9/2015
Today, I began building EssayMaker again from the ground up. I decided on using the Web as the only platform EssayMaker will run on. The new version will have to run on a multitude of devices: phones, tablets, computers, TVs, game consoles; everything. The way I'll do that is with a good starting point: for this project I'm using a library called Bootstrap, which will save a lot of time in the development of this project. I'm also using Marked, a Markdown processor for more advanced users. Of course, it'll be optional. On top of all that, I've built in a sentiment analyzer to give users an idea of the mood their essay is written in. I didn't have enough time to start actually designing the website, but I've got a good starting point.
