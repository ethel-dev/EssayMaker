CHANGELOG
=========
V0.1 - Essay Maker Scratch
--------------------------
You can find it here: http://sargeant45.wix.com/essaymaker

V0.2 - The "Input Output" Essay Maker
-------------------------------------
You can find it here:
https://github.com/sargeant45/Essay-Maker
- Ran in C# Command Prompt!
- Copied to the clipboard!
- Didn't support formatting!
- Totally primitive!

V0.3 - The Initial Version
--------------------------
- Added all of the essay elements.
- Added copy button.

V0.4 - Essay Maker BAMF-RTF
---------------------------
- Added a .RTF save button, and kept the copy button just in case :)
- Added essay elements that make sense. (expository 5-paragraph essay)
- Added tooltips for every part of the essay, replacing the names.
- Whole new layout!
- Works on smaller sized monitors!

V0.4.1 - Editing Features!
--------------------------
- Added a font button. Includes Courier, Times New Roman, (and for laughs) Comic Sans.
- Added an Accepts Tab switch. Now you can tab away to format!
- Speaking of tabs, with the switch off you can do the opposite! Tab order fixed.
- Added anchors that kind of work.

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
- Accepts Tab switch will not switch back.

V0.5 - The Save Update
----------------------
- Now the Font button will affect your saved file too!
- New Size upDownNumeric box (that uppy downy counter thingy) to change fontsize.
- Copy button has fonts!
- Save button now right aligns your name, teacher's name, and the date. (copy button DOES NOT due to laziness. I don't know, open up an issue if you want it)
- Pull request from *cusmonaut* that removes files that should have been removed from .gitignore. Thanks!
- Save button revamped! Code completely changed and works 30 times faster and formatting sticks, like I've said before.
